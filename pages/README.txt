	This app is responsible for the home and about pages. The associated views,
found in its views.py, include HomePageView and AboutPageView, both pointing to their
respective templates. The urls.py file connects these views to the main application.
The testing for this app is to ensure that users get sent to the correct location when
the home page or the about page is supposed to appear.
