	This application is a Translator app that allows users to convert from normal text
to binary and vice versa. It focuses on providing an aesthetically pleasing way for 
users to translate and save chunks of text when logged in. It relies on three apps 
pages, users, and Translator which are responsible for the home/about pages, user 
registration, and translations respectively. Of course, the apps contain the associated
working URL's for each of the many views needed to make this application work.
The templates are built to ensure that information gets output in an eye-pleasing 
manner correctly. My database keeps track of the content that the user 
inputs and the output of my translation functions and views. The application
includes extensive user authentication functions such as signup, login, password 
change, and password reset. The website has restricted access to users that are 
not logged in even when said unauthorized user knows the URL patterns. On top of this, 
the application uses a combination of HTML, CSS, Bootstrapping to provide interactive 
buttons that change color and size when cursed over. There are also many primitive 
tests included in each app to ensure that the views and models are functioning properly.

	I was and still am extremely new to HTML, Django, and web development as a whole. 
When I start this project I didn't even know how to go about it. Using our class project 
NewsPaperApp as an example, however, I quickly got more and more into the whole process.
I am looking forward to improving this site in the future to take in and output 
text dynamically during translation like my original vision for this application. 
Overall, this project was fascinating and has shown me how I can begin to implement 
the useful website ideas that made me want to take this class.
